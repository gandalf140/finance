* 401k loan
** switching jobs - avoid loan default penalty
*** transfer from Pragmatics to ATA

*** new employer with 401k
**** *rollover to 401k and take out new 401k loan to pay off old (best case)*
     - rollover old 401k to new 401k
     - old loan defaults
     - take out loan from new 401k and put it in IRA to amount of old loan
     - then report on 1099 that loan amount was put into IRA
     - questions for new 401k provider
       - how soon can rollover happen and how soon is loan available?
**** take out third party loan and pay off 401k loan
      - then take out new 401k loan and pay off third party loan to avoid
        interest
      - do this if there isn't time for the rollover/loan from new 401k before
        the old loan defaults
*** new employer without 401k
**** third party loan
     - take out third party loan and pay off the 401k loan to avoid the
       penalty/taxes
     - downside is paying higher interest on third party loan
**** rollover to IRA and contribute some partial amount of loan
     - if can't pay off full amount of loan, could reduce the amount 
       penalized by however much can be contributed into an IRA
**** rollover to IRA and cash out from 401k at same time to cover penalty
     - downsides are cash out is penalized itself and then you're using it to
       pay off the loan penalty
